# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##overview 
The goal of this project was to act as a Human Resources Analyst from Pwelett_Hackard to determine employee resurace to figure out who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill. This analysis will see who is eligible for retirementpackage. I used sequal to generate a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package and a list of how many job titles are going to be open after that generation of employees retires for the Sales and Development teams.
